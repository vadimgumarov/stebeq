## CRITICAL SAFETY RULES

### Session Start Protocol (MANDATORY)
1. **ALWAYS read docs/CONTINUATION.md FIRST** - Get current state and next steps
2. **Read CLAUDE.md** - Understand process rules and workflows  
3. **Read this file (.claude_project)** - Get project context
4. **State current context** - [branch: ... | issue: #... | status: ...]
5. **Proceed with TDD workflow** - Tests first, then implementation

### Project-Specific Data Integrity
*[CUSTOMIZE: Replace with your project's data safety rules]*

**Example Templates - Replace with your actual rules:**
```
- NEVER use [unsafe_data_source] - [reason], use [safe_alternative] only
- [service_name] is source of truth - All [data_type] from [service_name] API
- [component_name] DISABLED - Returns empty responses, use [replacement]
- [environment_name] only - Use [environment] instead of [unsafe_environment]
```

### Safety Defaults
*[CUSTOMIZE: Replace with your project's safety defaults]*

**Example Templates - Replace with your actual defaults:**
```
- Default to [safe_environment] environment/mode
- Default to [safe_option] ([reason - e.g., "24/7 availability"])  
- Default to [safe_configuration]
- Run [safety_checks] before [critical_action]
```

### Documentation Enforcement (MANDATORY)
- **PROGRESS.md** - MUST update when completing any issue
- **CONTINUATION.md** - MUST update when switching tasks or completing work
- **Both files** - MUST be updated before committing with "Complete Issue #" or "Closes #"
- **State tracking** - MUST include [branch: ... | issue: #... | status: ...] in every response

### STRICTLY PROHIBITED APPROACHES - NO EXCEPTIONS
**Always fix the root problem. These workarounds are NEVER acceptable:**
- ❌ **Switching ports/URLs** - Fix the blocking issue, don't change ports
- ❌ **Mocking real components** - Fix the import/dependency, don't mock
- ❌ **Hardcoding values** - Fix the config/system, don't hardcode  
- ❌ **Skipping tests** - Fix the failing code, don't skip tests
- ❌ **Commenting out code** - Debug and fix, don't comment out
- ❌ **Creating "simplified" versions** - Fix the full system
- ❌ **Workarounds instead of fixes** - Fix the root cause

See CLAUDE.md "RED FLAGS" section for full details.

```

**✅ Correct Pattern**: `[GoodExample]` [description of why this follows your principle]  
**❌ Prohibited Pattern**: `[BadExample]` + `[AnotherBadExample]` [description of why this violates your principle]

## TESTING STRATEGY (ENTERPRISE TDD)

*[CUSTOMIZE: Define your specific TDD implementation]*
```
1. Write Failing Test:
   - [test_command] [specific_test_file]
   - Verify test fails for the right reason
   
2. Write Minimal Implementation:
   - Code just enough to make test pass
   - No premature optimization
   
3. Refactor Safely:
   - Improve code while keeping tests green
   - Run full test suite after refactoring
   
4. Integration Testing:
   - Test component interactions
   - Use real dependencies, no mocks
   
5. End-to-End Testing:
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Verify business value delivery
```

### Test Data Management
*[CUSTOMIZE: Define test data strategies]*
```
- Test Database: [separate test database strategy]
- Test Data: [factories, fixtures, or generated data]
- Cleanup Strategy: [how tests clean up after themselves]
- Isolation: [how tests avoid interfering with each other]

Example:
- Test DB: Separate PostgreSQL instance with Docker
- Test Data: Factory Boy with realistic fake data
- Cleanup: Automatic transaction rollback after each test
- Isolation: Each test runs in its own transaction
```

### Performance & Load Testing
*[CUSTOMIZE: Define performance testing approach]*
```
- Performance Targets: [response times, throughput, etc.]
- Load Testing Tools: [k6, JMeter, Artillery, etc.]
- Monitoring: [APM tools, custom metrics]
- Regression Testing: [automated performance regression detection]

Example:
- Targets: 95th percentile < 200ms, 1000 concurrent users
- Tools: k6 for load testing, Prometheus for monitoring
- CI Integration: Performance tests in staging environment
- Alerts: Automatic alerts for 20% performance degradation
```

- Authorization: RBAC with role hierarchy
- Encryption: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- Scanning: CodeQL, Snyk, automated in CI/CD
```

### Compliance & Auditing
*[CUSTOMIZE: Define compliance requirements if applicable]*
```
- Standards: [GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.]
